Issues & Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several issues that need to be addressed. Contributions are welcome.

* **Environments**

  * Fixed nxn space
  * No obstacles
  * Dirt distribution

* **Agents**

  * Most importantly more learning, fewer rules
  * Perhaps split into distinct agents with varying degrees of capability (simple reflex, model-based reflex, goal-based, utility-based, and complex learning agents)

* **Plots**

  * PNGs are temporarily stored in a directory to create GIFs
  * A contour plot is better suited for plotting 3 dimensional surfaces
